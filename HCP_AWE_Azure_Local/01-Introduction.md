## Introduction “Advancing File Services for the Hybrid Cloud Era: A Technical Guide to HCP Anywhere Enterprise, HCP for Cloud Scale, and UCP for Azure Local Integration”

In today's dynamic and data-driven business landscape, organizations are
increasingly adopting cloud and hybrid cloud strategies to enhance
agility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. As these IT environments
become more complex and distributed, the need for robust and intelligent
file sharing solutions has never been more critical. Advanced file
sharing solutions play a pivotal role in enabling seamless
collaboration, ensuring data accessibility, and maintaining the security
and integrity of corporate data across diverse platforms and locations.

The integration of HCP Anywhere Enterprise, HCP for Cloud Scale, and UCP
for Azure Local (previously known as Azure Stack HCI) is a powerful and
sophisticated file sharing solution that effectively addresses the
challenges faced by modern organizations. This integration provides
flexibility in both data placement and transportation, allowing
customers to choose from various scenarios based on their compliance
requirements and data usage patterns.

Customers can choose from various data placement and transportation
scenarios, depending on their specific requirements:

-   **On premises (purely off-cloud) approach**:

    -   Use Azure mainly as a global control plane for Azure Local
        clusters

    -   Ensure that data never traverses Hyperscalers' backbone networks

    -   Keep all data on-premises for strict compliance and data
        sovereignty

-   **Hybrid model**:

    -   Keep some data on-premises and some in the cloud

    -   Decide data placement based on specific compliance requirements
        and data usage patterns

    -   Maintain flexibility in data placement and transportation

-   **Cloud-first strategy**:

    -   Store all data in the cloud for maximum scalability and
        cost-efficiency

    -   Alternatively, keep most data in the cloud with a small portion
        on-premises

    -   Leverage cloud resources while maintaining some on-premises
        presence for specific requirements

Moreover, this integrated solution comes with various deployment
methods, making it easy for organizations to implement and manage their
file sharing infrastructure. One notable deployment method is **the use
of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.** ARM templates enable
organizations to define their infrastructure as code, allowing for
consistent, repeatable, and auditable deployments across different
environments. By leveraging ARM templates, organizations can quickly
provision and configure the necessary components, such as the HCP
Anywhere Enterprise Portal, Edge Filers, and storage resources, in a
streamlined, automated, and manageable manner.

The ease of deployment extends to other methods as well, such as using
PowerShell scripts or the Azure portal for provisioning and management.
These diverse deployment options provide organizations with the
flexibility to choose the method that best aligns with their existing
processes and skill sets, ensuring a smooth and efficient implementation
of the integrated solution.

The following sections provide brief introductions to the respective
core components of this integrated solution.

**UCP for Azure Local** is a powerful hybrid cloud solution that
combines the flexibility and scalability of Azure with the control and
performance of on-premises infrastructure. It leverages Microsoft's
proven virtualization, storage, and networking technologies, such as
Hyper-V, Storage Spaces Direct (S2D), and Software-Defined Networking
(SDN), to deliver a highly resilient and efficient platform for running
virtualized workloads. It also works seamlessly with **Hitachi VSP One
File**, flexibilizing edge-core-cloud data integrations.

**HCP Anywhere Enterprise**, on the other hand, is a leading
enterprise-grade file sharing and data management solution that enables
organizations to securely store, sync, and share files across edge,
core, and cloud environments. HCP Anywhere Enterprise's platform
comprises two key components:

-   **HCP Anywhere Enterprise Portal**:

    -   Central management and control plane for the entire ecosystem

    -   Unified interface for configuration, monitoring, and management

    -   Communicates with Edge Filers for secure data access and
        synchronization

-   **HCP Anywhere Enterprise Edge Filer**:

    -   Deployed at remote locations for local file access and caching

    -   Interfaces with the Portal for configuration and management

    -   Synchronizes data with the central repository

    -   Ensures low-latency file access and sharing at remote locations

Together, the HCP Anywhere Enterprise Portal and Edge Filer provide a
comprehensive and unified approach to file services, data protection,
and collaboration, enabling organizations to securely store, sync, and
share files across edge, core, and cloud environments.

**HCP for Cloud Scale** is a software-defined object storage solution
from Hitachi Vantara that is built on a microservices architecture and
provides massive scalability, high performance, and S3 compatibility.
Key features include:

-   Scales out to support hundreds of nodes and billions of objects

-   Can be deployed on Hitachi or third-party servers, or in public
    cloud environments

-   Efficiently manages metadata separately from object data for
    scalability

-   Provides built-in data security, protection and advanced
    metadata-based data management

-   Enables hybrid cloud workflows and integration with cloud services

-   Offers S3 API compatibility along with valuable extensions

-   Includes an intelligent policy engine for automating data management
    tasks at scale

By integrating HCP Anywhere Enterprise and HCP for Cloud Scale with UCP
for Azure Local, organizations can unlock a host of strategic
advantages. This powerful combination allows businesses to:

-   **Enhance file sharing capabilities** across edge, core, and cloud
    environments, ensuring seamless access to data regardless of
    location with flexible data placement and transportation options
    based on compliance requirements and data usage patterns

-   **Improve data protection and business continuity** by leveraging
    HCP Anywhere Enterprise's advanced backup and disaster recovery
    features.

-   **Simplify management and reduce complexity** by consolidating file
    services and virtualization on a single, unified platform

-   **Achieve greater cost-efficiency** by optimizing storage resources
    and minimizing data transfer costs. Ensure compliance with industry
    regulations and data sovereignty requirements through flexible
    deployment options and granular control over versatile data
    placement

The integration of HCP Anywhere Enterprise and HCP for Cloud Scale with
Azure Local empowers organizations to build a future-ready IT
infrastructure that can adapt to evolving business needs, support
distributed workflows, and drive innovation in the era of hybrid cloud
computing.
