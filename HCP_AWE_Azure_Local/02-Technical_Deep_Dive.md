The HCP Anywhere Enterprise Edge Filer is a core component of HCP
Anywhere Enterprise's file sharing solution, designed to provide local
file services and caching at ROBO (remote offices and branch offices)
and edge locations. It offers a wide range of features, including:

-   Local file access and sharing using standard protocols like SMB and
    NFS

-   Intelligent caching of frequently accessed files to optimize
    performance

-   Integration with Active Directory and LDAP for user authentication
    and access control

-   Automated backup and synchronization with the HCP Anywhere
    Enterprise Portal

-   “Direct mode” allowing up to 10x faster transfer speeds compared to
    non-Direct Mode

##### Direct Mode Explained

HCP Anywhere Enterprise's Direct Mode enables data to be uploaded and
downloaded directly between Edge Filers and S3-compatible storage nodes,
such as, **HCP for Cloud Scale**, bypassing the HCP Anywhere Enterprise
Portal.

</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

Direct Mode offers up to 10x faster transfer speeds compared to
non-Direct Mode, depending on factors like disk type, network latency,
and antivirus software on the portal. It reduces latency by chunking
data and transferring it in parallel, using up to 100 concurrent
connections per endpoint, with only **metadata** sent to the Portal.

Data is securely transmitted using HTTPS when Direct Mode is enabled.

Direct Mode is ideal for distributed data-intensive workloads, such as
media files, healthcare imaging, and video surveillance.

In addition to enhanced transfer speed, Direct Mode provides the
capability to balance data sovereignty while providing high performance.
Users can store only metadata in the Portal (regardless of whether the
Portal is installed on-premises or in Azure), **while keeping the actual
data contents stored where they should be, according to compliance and
regulatory requirements**. This separation of metadata and data allows
organizations to maintain control over their actual data placement while
benefiting from the performance advantages of Direct Mode.

        locations), bypassing the Portal

    4.  Use Cases/Scenarios:

        -   Organizations with distributed workforces and multiple
            branch offices requiring fast local access to data while
            leveraging cloud storage for scalability and cost-efficiency

        -   Environments with a mix of high-performance workloads and
            less latency-sensitive data, where Direct Mode can be
            selectively enabled for specific Edge Filers or datasets

        -   Scenarios where the Portal must be hosted in the cloud for
            easier management and maintenance while ensuring data can be
            stored in the most appropriate location

##### Cloud-First Deployment:
